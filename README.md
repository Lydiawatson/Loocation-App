# Loocation-App
Code for Loocation App developed by Team Dioversity for Technovation Challenge 2016


This app was built in New Zealand, so all of the loos it currently displays are there. Please search for Auckland to see the loos currently saved.

This app was written using HTML, CSS and Javascript and was intended to be configured by Adobe's Phonegap. To test our software download this repository as a folder and open the index.html file - the app will run as a web page in your browser. Due to chrome's security features, the geolocation functionality will not work in Chrome.
